#' Find the Degree of Vertices in a Hypergraph
#'
#' The degree of a vertex is a way of expressing how many connections there
#' are from a vertex to the rest of the hypergraph. The current version of
#' rhype has three methods for computing degree.
#'
#' `"vertex"` counts the number of ways it is possible to move to another
#' vertex. If there are multiple hyperedges connecting two vertices, then each
#' of these hyperedges will be counted as a new way to move between these two
#' vertices. For weighted hypergraphs or hypergraphs with real coefficients,
#' the strength of connection between two vertices is a functions of the weights
#' and real coefficients.
#'
#' `"vertex_simple"` just counts the number of vertices it is possible to reach
#' in one step from the given vertex, no matter how many hyperedges connect them.
#'
#' `"hyperedge"` represents the strength with which a vertex connects with
#' itself through the hyperedges it is a member of. This is taken from the work
#' of Jurgen Jost and Raffaella Mulas \doi{10.1016/j.aim.2019.05.025}. For
#' unweighted hypergraphs without real coefficients this is equivalent to
#' `"hyperedge_simple"`.
#'
#' `"hyperedge_simple"` just counts the number of hyperedges a vertex is a
#' member of.
#'
#' @param hype A hypergraph object
#' @param method The method for calculating degree. Out of `"vertex"`,
#' `"vertex_simple"`, `"hyperedge"` and `"hyperedge_simple"`
#'
#' @return A vector representing the degree of each vertex with respect to the
#' given method.
